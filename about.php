<p>The Cliffs Tracker is an open-source PHP project that queries <a href="https://thecliffsclimbing.com">The Cliffs</a> website for the current amount of climbers at each gym and logs it to a SQLite database. Then that information is exposed via charts and graphs on this website.</p>

<p>If you would like to help out please feel free to open <a href="https://github.com/KovuTheHusky/thecliffstracker.com/issues">issues</a> or <a href="https://github.com/KovuTheHusky/thecliffstracker.com">fork us on GitHub</a> and open a <a href="https://github.com/KovuTheHusky/thecliffstracker.com/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>
